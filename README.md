# git-review

Interactive branch comparison tool for reviewing changes before creating a PR.

## Features

- 🔍 Compare any two branches with a visual diff in your editor
- ✅ Selectively stage/commit only the changes you want
- 🎨 Beautiful colored CLI output
- 💬 Interactive branch selection with arrow keys
- 🔄 Fetches remote branches automatically
- 🚀 Works globally in any git repository
- ⚡ Fast CLI mode when all flags provided

## Installation

The tool is already installed globally via `npm link`. You can use it anywhere!

```bash
git-review --help
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Just run the command and select branches using arrow keys:
```bash
git-review
```

This will:
1. Fetch all local and remote branches
2. Prompt you to select the FROM branch (defaults to current)
3. Prompt you to select the TO branch (defaults to main/master)
4. Create the review branch with uncommitted changes

### CLI Mode (Fast)

Provide all flags to skip interactive prompts:
```bash
# Compare specific branches (no prompts)
git-review --from=feature-branch --to=main

# Partial flags (will prompt for missing ones)
git-review --to=develop

# Use custom suffix
git-review --from=feat/new --to=main --suffix=-pr

# Skip all confirmation prompts
git-review --from=feat/new --to=main --no-interactive
```

## How It Works

### Complete Interactive Workflow

1. **Select branches** - Choose FROM and TO branches (or provide via flags)
2. **Creates review branch** - Based on the target branch with all changes uncommitted
3. **Review in editor** - Opens VSCode Source Control to review each file
4. **Wait prompt** - CLI asks if you want to wait for review and finalize
5. **Stage changes** - You selectively stage only the files you want
6. **Press Enter** - Return to CLI when done reviewing
7. **Auto-finalize** - Commits staged changes and replaces original branch
8. **Optional push** - Optionally push to remote with `--force-with-lease`

### Result
Your original feature branch is replaced with only the reviewed/approved changes!

## Example Workflow

### Interactive Mode (Complete Flow)

```bash
# Start the review process
git-review

# CLI prompts:
# → Select source branch (FROM): feat/my-feature ✓
# → Select target branch (TO): main ✓
# → Wait for review and finalize changes? Yes ✓

# CLI creates review branch and waits...
# → Review your changes in the editor, then press Enter to continue...

# Now you review in VSCode:
# 1. Open Source Control (Ctrl+Shift+G)
# 2. Click each file to see the diff
# 3. Stage files you want (✓)
# 4. Discard unwanted changes (✗)
# 5. Press Enter in terminal when done

# CLI continues:
# → Found 12 staged file(s)
# → Replace 'feat/my-feature' with reviewed changes? Yes ✓
# → Enter commit message: Clean PR ready for review ✓
# → Push changes to remote? Yes ✓

# Done! Your feat/my-feature branch now has only approved changes
```

### CLI Mode (Fast, No Prompts)

```bash
git-review --from=feat/new --to=main --no-interactive
# Creates review branch, you manually review and commit
```
